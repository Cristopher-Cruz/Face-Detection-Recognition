# Face-Recognition
### This repository contains multiple python scripts that use AI/deep learning to recognize images/faces.

## File 1 : faceRecognition.py 
### How it works : 
1. Loads images from a specified directory
2. Encodes images from step 1
3. Opens webcam and encodes the current live feed
4. Checks if there is a match between the encoded images and the live frames encoded

The script uses **openCV** and the **face_recognition** api
